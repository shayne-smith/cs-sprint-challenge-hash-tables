1) Hashing functions

Hashing functions take input of arbitrary size, perform some computation on input, and produce a fixed-size output. 

2) Collision resolution

Collisions occur when a hashing functions maps an input to same output as another value. Linked Lists can correct this issue by creating a singly-linked list at the output value to store an arbitrary amount of data.

3) Performance of basic hash table operations

Hash tables can search, insert, and delete all in constant time O(1).

4) Load factor

Number of items in hash table/ total number of slots. Linear probing allows for a max load factor of 1 while collision resolution allows for a load factor greater than 1.

5) Automatic resizing

To minimize the probability of collisions, automatic resizing is employed. Even though it's a costly operation, the average time complexity is still O(1) even with resizing.

6) Various use cases for hash tables

Caches, records, digital phone book, DNS management systems, library system, lookup tables, etc.
